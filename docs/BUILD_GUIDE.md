# BUILD_GUIDE — how the translated ROM is built, step by step

This is the practical companion to `ROM_STRUCTURE.md` (layout + address map),
`TEXT_SYSTEM.md` (encoding), and `STAGE_FORMAT.md` (stage files). It explains how to run
the build, what each phase does and in what order, how to make a change safely, and — for
the worst case — how to rebuild the whole thing from first principles without this repo's
code, using only the documented formats and addresses.

---

## 1. Building with this repo (the normal path)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python build/build.py "0098 - SD Gundam G Generation DS (Japan).nds" sd-gundam-g-generation-zh.nds
```

* Input: the Japanese cartridge dump, sha1 `12443b91297a57bcd2ace8da989c26ae635a79fd`.
* Output: `sd-gundam-g-generation-zh.nds`, 30,359,400 B, sha1
  `11e0e03b6d8e491e8cda5f4bd45cdab4ea90808c`; with `--pad32m` also the 32 MiB 0xFF-padded
  image (sha1 `d050f272cb4a330926b5f011a31b68a2484cf079`). (`data/manifest.json` is the
  authoritative record of all three hashes.)
* The build is a **single deterministic pass** (~5 s). Every component is verified against
  `data/manifest.json`; the final ROM hash is verified last. `--skip-verify` downgrades
  hash mismatches to warnings — the mode you use while editing translations.

Then verify:

```bash
.venv/bin/python test/run_static.py sd-gundam-g-generation-zh.nds          # static gates (46)
.venv/bin/python test/live/test_boot_render.py sd-gundam-g-generation-zh.nds  # emulator boot
```

The JP side of every translation key is browsable in `data/jp/` — the committed
dump of `build/extract_data_from_game.py` (the single extraction path; the
`extraction_fresh` gate keeps it honest, `build/reconcile_extraction.py` proves
the mapping complete in both directions).

## 2. What the build does, in order

`build/build.py` orchestrates four component builders (all in `utils/`):

### Phase 1 — code binary (`utils/arm9_layout.py`)

Starting from the Japanese arm9 image (1,797,560 B):

1. **Validate input** — ModuleParams words, list layout, expected size (§3 of
   `ROM_STRUCTURE.md`). A wrong or already-built image is rejected.
2. **Bake semantic tables** (from `data/zh/units.json`, `zh/characters.json`,
   `zh/ui.json`; geometry from `utils/extract/layout.py`):
   unit names → master table `0xB94BC`; weapon names → the 6 sub-records per unit;
   pilot names → character DB `0xDCF18`; ID-command names/summaries/details → table
   `0xEC994` + detail offset table `0xF9048`; ability strings + their 583 pointer sites;
   parts-name offsets `0x16B474`; UI label literal sites; the text-macro dictionary at
   `0x12D770` (offset repoints + re-encoded entries).
3. **Write string pools** (`data/zh/placements/` + `zh/event_text.json`): in-place pools (battle names, detail pool,
   menu descriptors, resident caves), the 1,267 event/briefing text blocks in
   `0x1985A4..0x1AD520`, and the two relocated banks that later become autoload payloads.
4. **Apply code patches** (`data/patches/code_patches.json`, 39 entries, then
   `data/patches/raw_regions.json`, currently empty): render-path trampolines + caves,
   decoder hooks, one-byte fixes, gameplay threshold tweaks. Every patch asserts its
   recorded `old_hex` before writing — a shifted base fails loudly. Both files are
   audited by the same gates (`patch_literal_safety` scans raw-region writes for paved
   live bytes and forbidden literals exactly like cave bodies; `placement_span_safety`
   includes them in the writer-overlap scan; the `hp_format_liveness` invariant pins the
   ISSUE-6 "D4"/"/D4" HP format strings and their four consumer literals byte-exact JP).
5. **Append the autoload tail**: 12×12 glyph atlas (`data/font/atlas12.bin`, `0x25F80` B)
   + pool A (`0x2028C` B) + pool B (`0x98FC` B) + the new 5-entry autoload list; patch
   ModuleParams (`0xB0C/0xB10`), the renderer atlas pointer (`0x1315C` → `0x023027A0`)
   and the heap floor (`0xA48F8` → `0x02348A00`). Mechanism: `ROM_STRUCTURE.md` §3.
6. **Self-check** — sha1 vs `data/manifest.json`.

Order matters only within arm9 in one respect: pools must be written before pointer
tables are verified against them, and the appended tail goes last (it defines the final
image size). The builder handles this internally.

### Phase 2 — stage dialogue (`utils/stage_text.py`)

For each of the 101 `_STG*.bin` files (data in `data/zh/stages/<name>.json`):

1. **Splice** all byte-range edits (translated `0x15 … 00 00` dialogue blocks, plus
   `script`-kind ranges) and inserts (alignment padding) in original-file coordinates.
2. **Relocate pointers**: every genuine absolute pointer (value in
   `[0x0232C800, base+len)`, classification rules in `STAGE_FORMAT.md`) whose target sits
   at/after an insertion point is bumped by the accumulated growth.
3. **Assert invariants**: built size, fit in the `0x13800` RAM buffer, all pointers
   resolve in-file, header tables at `0x04/0x08/0x10/0x14/0x18` stay 4-byte aligned
   (misalignment = rotated `ldr` on ARMv5 = black screen at stage load).

### Phase 3 — misc data files (`utils/data_files.py`)

Twenty files, four data layouts (schemas in `DATA_FORMATS.md`): bark banks (in-place
re-encoded runs), the grown cut-in quote bank (whole-file rebuild; its offset table lives
in arm9 and was already written in phase 1 — the two must agree), fixed-size name tables,
and raw-tile graphics repaints (asserted against original bytes).

### Phase 4 — container assembly (`utils/rom.py` + ndspy)

Replace `rom.arm9` and the 121 changed NitroFS files **by index** in the loaded Japanese
ROM, `rom.save()`, verify final sha1. ndspy reproduces the container byte-identically
(header CRC16 recomputed automatically; the stale secure-area CRC is correct behaviour —
see `ROM_STRUCTURE.md` §1). The 12-byte nitrocode footer rides along as `arm9PostData`.

## 3. Changing a translation (the edit loop)

The canonical build inputs are **encoded payloads** (`zh_hex` / `payload_hex`); the
`zh`/`zh_text` fields are the human-readable view. That means:

* **Text-table entries that re-encode at build time** (`data/zh/files/*` banks): edit the `zh` text, rebuild with `--skip-verify`, run `test/run_static.py`.
  The text must encode (all chars must exist in the glyph atlas — the codec raises on
  unknown chars) and fit the recorded size budget (builders assert).
* **Entries with canonical hex** (`data/zh/stages/*.json` dialogue edits,
  `data/zh/placements/*`): re-encode the new text with `utils/text_codec.encode()` (stage
  dialogue convention: prefer the Chinese-region atlas slot for any char that has one —
  see `TEXT_SYSTEM.md`), keep length ≤ the recorded replacement length (pad with trailing
  `0x00`), keep the block terminator clean, and update both `zh_text` and `zh_hex`.
  LENGTH changes move you off the verified layout: growth shifts pointers everywhere
  after the edit, so `script`-kind edits' embedded pre-relocated pointers would desync.
  Prefer equal-length rewrites; for real growth, regenerate the stage's edit list.
* **Width rule**: translated text must render no wider than the Japanese it replaces
  (12 px/glyph on the dialogue path, 8 px on the UI path, macros expanded). The static
  suite enforces this; violating it clips or freezes UI (`LESSONS_LEARNED.md`).
* **New glyphs**: if a character isn't in the atlas, add a 12×12 bitmap to a free slot ≥
  4,320 would require growing the atlas (size is pinned by the autoload list — the build
  computes it) and mapping the char in `data/charmap.json` (`two_byte_zh`). Check first
  whether the char already exists (`slot_chars_extra` names late-added slots).

After edits, expect `component hash mismatch` warnings (that's the point); when the new
state is intended, refresh that component's hash in `data/manifest.json` and re-run the
full test ladder (`test/README.md`).

## 4. Rebuilding from first principles (no streamlined code)

If you ever have to reproduce this work from scratch — or do the same for another game —
this is the distilled recipe. Addresses below are this game's (see `ROM_STRUCTURE.md` §4
for the full map); the *method* generalizes.

1. **Split the container.** `ndspy` (or `ndstool -x`) → header, arm9(+footer), arm7,
   FNT/FAT, files. Establish the byte-identity baseline: load + save must round-trip.
2. **Find the text.** Dump printable-looking byte runs; correlate with on-screen text in
   an emulator. Here: dialogue lives in `_STG*.bin` as `0x15 … 00 00` blocks; names live
   in arm9 pools pointed at by fixed-stride tables (units `0xB94BC`/0xD8, pilots
   `0xDCF18`/0x48, ID commands `0xEC994`/0x24); barks/cut-ins/encyclopedia in flat
   `.bin` files with u16/u32 offset tables (often in arm9, e.g. cut-ins `0x16EEA8`).
3. **Crack the encoding.** This game: 1-byte codes < 0xE0 (code == glyph slot),
   2-byte `0xE0xx` glyph tokens (slot = token − 0xDF20), `0xF0xx` dictionary macros
   (u16-offset-table dicts at `0x12D770` (dialogue/UI) and `0x1444B4` (frozen)). Build a
   slot→char map by rendering the glyph atlas (each slot = 36 B, 12×12 2 bpp) and
   OCR/eyeballing; verify by decoding known screens. **Never hand-type token hex.**
4. **Plan glyph capacity.** The stock atlas has 2,196 slots; Chinese needs ~2,000 more.
   Append a grown atlas (4,320 slots) as a boot-time autoload payload at the BSS-clear
   boundary (`0x023027A0`), bump the heap floor literal above it, and repoint the ONE
   renderer atlas-base literal (`0x1315C`). The 8×16 UI-font path can't hold CJK — add a
   trampoline at its glyph-blit start (`0x131D8`) that routes slots ≥ 2,196 through the
   12×12 path. (Both mechanisms in `ROM_STRUCTURE.md` §2–4.)
5. **Translate into structure, not over bytes.** Keep JP→ZH tables keyed by record
   identity (unit id, command id, block offset). Encode with a deterministic convention
   (here: ZH-region slot first, then 1-byte code, then JP slot; skip tokens whose low
   byte would be 0x00/0x15). Respect per-site byte budgets, or implement growth:
   * stage files: splice + relocate absolute pointers + keep header tables 4-aligned;
   * arm9 strings: longer text goes to relocated pools (dead caves, or new autoload
     banks above the heap ceiling) with the table pointer re-aimed; **verify the target
     region is truly dead in EVERY game state** — "unused" RAM is stage-dependent.
6. **Patch code only where data can't reach**: render clamps/dispatch, decoder hooks,
   bounds checks. Document every patch {offset, old, new, why} and assert `old` when
   applying. Gameplay tweaks are code patches too — keep them explicit and separate.
7. **Gate everything.** Byte-level static gates first (audio header `0x60`, structural
   byte-identity outside known-safe frames, token-aware block integrity, pointer validity,
   alignment, width budgets, coverage ratchets) — they catch 90% of regressions in
   seconds. Then emulator boot/freeze tests, then screenshot + vision-model judging of
   actual rendered crops (pixel metrics alone mislead). Details: `TESTING_APPROACH.md`.
8. **Byte-identity as the finish line.** When refactoring a working hack (what this repo
   is), extract each changed region into semantic data + builder code, rebuild, and
   compare hashes per component. `diff → classify → semanticize → re-verify` until the
   residual patch set is empty.

## 5. Key insights (the short list)

* **The container round-trips**: per-component byte-identity ⇒ whole-ROM byte-identity.
  Work component-by-component; never hand-patch the assembled image.
* **One codec everywhere**: dialogue, names, barks, cut-ins, briefings all share the
  glyph-token grammar; only the surrounding framing differs (blocks vs pools vs offset
  tables). Token-aware scanning is mandatory — a `0xE0xx/0xF0xx` low byte may be
  `0x00`/`0x15`, so byte-wise scans corrupt (this caused two shipped crashes: false
  dialogue blocks over script jump pointers, and mis-sliced block frames).
* **Growth is a relocation problem**: stage files and arm9 both tolerate text growth
  fine — as long as every absolute pointer is re-aimed and alignment-sensitive tables
  stay 4-aligned. ARMv5 rotates unaligned `ldr` loads instead of faulting; the resulting
  wild pointers crash far from the cause.
* **RAM "free space" must be proven, not assumed**: the BSS clear, the heap arena, and
  the stage work buffer each silently destroy bytes parked in the wrong band; the only
  always-safe homes are the resident image, the BSS-boundary autoload block (with the
  heap floor bumped), and above the heap ceiling.
* **Width and memory budgets are the real translation constraints** — Chinese is denser
  than Japanese, which usually helps, but every UI field has a pixel budget and every
  block a byte budget; the static gates encode both.
* **Trust only the actual rendered screen** (emulator + vision judgment) for render
  correctness; trust only byte-level gates for structural safety. Each catches what the
  other can't.
