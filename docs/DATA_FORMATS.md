# DATA_FORMATS — schema reference for `data/`

The JP ROM is the single source of truth; `data/` holds its two derived sides
plus the shared glyph system. Global conventions:

* JSON is UTF-8, `ensure_ascii=False`, `indent=1`; offsets/pointers/ids are `"0x…"` hex
  strings unless noted; `*_hex` fields are raw bytes in lowercase hex.
* `zh`/`zh_text` fields are human-readable translation text; where a sibling
  `zh_hex`/`payload_hex` exists, the **hex is the canonical build input** (the encoded
  form is the artifact; the text is the view). Where no hex sibling exists, the text is
  re-encoded at build time through `utils/text_codec.py` and must round-trip.
* Text fields may contain escapes produced by the codec: `{00}` separator/pad, `{01}`,
  `{03}`, `{04}`… control bytes, `{F0:n}` dictionary macro n, `{SLOT:n}` glyph slot
  without a charmap character (`{B:n}` = unidentified renderB glyph in data/jp).
* Table geometry (bases, strides, field offsets) lives ONCE in
  `utils/extract/layout.py` — data files carry only keys and values.
* Every builder self-checks its output sha1 against `manifest.json`.

## jp/ — the extracted ground truth (generated; never hand-edit)

Output of `build/extract_data_from_game.py` (see `data/jp/README.md` for the
per-file inventory). Every record carries its exact ROM location — `ptr_site`
(the pointer word's file offset), `off`/`len` (the string bytes), or
`record`/`index` (table keys) — plus a loss-aware per-surface transcription.
The `extraction_fresh` gate pins committed == fresh; `build/reconcile_extraction.py`
(gate `zh_reconciliation`) proves every zh key maps onto a record here.

## extraction/ — curated extractor inputs

Knowledge the bytes cannot provide: `library_bio_map.json` (encyclopedia bio
index → owning cid/utid; no in-ROM index table exists) and
`stage_speakers.json` (per-block speaker cid + real player forks).

## manifest.json

```jsonc
{
 "source_rom":        {"sha1": …, "size": …},   // the Japanese dump the build requires
 "output_rom":        {"sha1": …, "size": …},   // the translated ROM
 "output_rom_padded": {"sha1": …, "size": …},   // the 32 MiB padded variant
 "components": {"arm9": sha1, "_STG00.bin": sha1, …}   // all 129 built components
}
```

## charmap.json (→ `utils/text_codec.py`)

| key | mapping | role |
|---|---|---|
| `one_byte` | char → code 0x00–0xDF | 1-byte codes; the code IS the glyph slot |
| `two_byte_zh` | char → preferred atlas slot | Chinese encoding identities (normally slot ≥ 2196; a few liveness-proved, stage-only legacy glyphs occupy candidate-dead JP-band cells) |
| `jp_slot_chars` | slot 224–2195 → char | original Japanese glyphs (decode aid) |
| `slot_chars_extra` | slot → char | decode-side identity refinements (incl. the VLM-identified atlas cells); **override decoding only** — encoding preferences are frozen so build output can't drift |

## renderb_charset.json

`slots`: renderB 8x16 UI-font identities. Slots < 224 carry `{char, kind}` with
word-level proof; slots ≥ 224 (`kind: "ident"`) are the kanji-band identities
from the one-shot VLM contact-sheet campaign — decode aids that deliberately
never affect gate behavior (kana-leak detection keys on `kind == "kana"`).

## font/atlas12.bin

The 12×12 glyph atlas autoload payload, verbatim: 4,320 slots × 36 bytes (2 bpp,
12 rows × 3 bytes). Slots 0–2195 = original glyphs, 2196+ = added Chinese glyphs.
Copied to RAM `0x023027A0` at boot. Slot semantics in `charmap.json`.

## jp/gallery.json + zh/gallery.json (→ `utils/gallery_titles.py`)

`jp/gallery.json` is extractor-owned. It pins SHA-256/size and record identities for
the six coupled mode0 resources: EV titles (`43f.bin` + `440.bin`), character library
titles (`322.bin` + `323.bin`), and unit library titles (`b38.bin` + `b39.bin`). The
metadata files carry relative offsets into their companion banks, so each pair is
rebuilt together and all owned offsets are read back after repacking. Series IDs are
assigned from exact `series_raw_hex`, never decoded text. All `*_jp` / `series.jp`
fields are best-effort decoder annotations and may improve without changing identity.
Fixed bank prefix/tail padding is extractor-recorded, asserted, and preserved verbatim.

`zh/gallery.json` deliberately contains only 54 EV translations and the 28 unique
series translations. The 274 character names and 239 unit names are joined by
`char_id`/`utid` from the canonical rosters; an optional roster `gallery_zh` overrides
only the constrained display spelling. The gallery renderer uses the mode0/renderB
trampoline, not the stage encoder: translated glyphs must use safe high atlas slots
or a native-direct byte already present as a standalone token in that same JP record.
The source-byte inventory is token-aware, so a two-byte token's low byte never grants
permission accidentally. Width gates model the actual advances
(6px narrow parentheses, 8px S/E/D and native direct glyphs, 12px other high slots):
104px EV, 104px series, 88px character name, 112px unit name.

## zh/stages/<_STGxx>.json (→ `utils/stage_text.py`)

Per stage file. `edits` are byte-range replacements in ORIGINAL-file coordinates
(`jp_offset` = the mapping key, pairing with `data/jp/stages/`), ascending and
non-overlapping; `inserts` are pure insertions.

```jsonc
{
 "file": "_STG05.bin", "source_size": 73388, "built_size": 76180,
 "edits": [{
   "jp_offset": "0x111e", "jp_len": 9,
   "kind": "dialogue",            // exactly one 0x15…00 00 block ("script" = other ranges)
   "zh_text": "…",                // decoded view, never enters the build
   "zh_hex": "…"                  // canonical replacement bytes
 }],
 "inserts": [{"jp_offset": "0x41c", "hex": "0000", "reason": "table_alignment"}]
}
```

`script`-kind `zh_hex` may embed absolute pointers already relocated for the final
layout — don't change lengths by hand (see `BUILD_GUIDE.md` §3). Pointer relocation and
alignment rules: `STAGE_FORMAT.md`. JP text/play order/speaker per key:
`data/jp/stages/<stage>.json`.

## zh/units.json + zh/characters.json (→ `utils/arm9_layout.py`)

The semantic name mapping, grouped per owner:

```jsonc
// units.json
{"utid": 1, "zh": "∀高达", "ptr": "0x218C0C0",
 "weapons": [{"slot": 0, "zh": "光束军刀", "ptr": "0x218E864"}]}
// characters.json
{"cid": 2, "zh": "爱娜·萨哈林", "ptr": "0x218E68F",
 "ids": [{"idn": 6, "name": {"zh": "我的战争！！", "ptr": "0x2328FA9"},
          "summary": {"zh": "放水", "ptr": "0x218FEE4"}}]}
```

* `ptr` re-aims the record's pointer word at a relocated string (bytes live in
  `zh/placements/`); absent `ptr` = the string was rewritten in place inside a
  placement pool. `zh` is the annotation mirroring those bytes (regenerate with
  the per-surface decoder — see AGENTS.md).
* `characters.json detail_offsets` re-aims slots of the 256-entry effect-detail
  offset table (`didx`-keyed).
* `units.json carrier_capacity` is a deliberate gameplay override (Eternal = 6).

## zh/ui.json (→ `utils/arm9_layout.py`)

* `labels` / `abilities` — `{zh, old_ptr, ptr, sites[]}`: every literal pointer
  word in `sites` is re-aimed from `old_ptr` (asserted against the JP image) to
  `ptr`. Keys pair with `data/jp/ui.json pointer_strings`.
* `dictionary` — the text-macro store at `0x12D770`: `offset_entries`
  (re-aimed table slots) + `string_edits` (`{offset, zh, payload_hex}` in-place
  entry rewrites; hex canonical).
* `resource_offsets` — offset words pinning rebuilt files (`1da`, `1df`), with
  `old_value` asserts.

The cut-in quote offset table is NOT data: it is derived at build time from
`zh/files/battle/cutin_quotes.json` (geometry in `utils/extract/layout.py`).

## zh/event_text.json (→ `utils/arm9_layout.py`)

The story/briefing `0x15…00 00` blocks embedded in arm9: `{offset, length, zh,
payload_hex}`, byte-length-locked (briefing records point into pool B). Keys
pair with `data/jp/event_text.json`.

## zh/placements/ (→ `utils/arm9_layout.py`)

Encoded string storage, `{offset, text, payload_hex}` per entry (offsets are file
offsets into arm9, or bank-relative for the autoload banks):

* `battle_name_pool.json`, `idcmd_detail_pool.json`, `post_dict_labels.json`,
  `resident_caves.json` — in-place pools/caves inside the code image.
* `ui_names_bank.json` (→ RAM `0x02328720`) and `briefing_blobs.json`
  (→ RAM `0x023E7000`) — the two appended autoload banks. Note: only
  `[0x02328720, 0x0232C800)` of pool A is referenced at runtime; the remainder is
  retired data kept byte-exact on purpose (see `ROM_STRUCTURE.md` §2).
* `relocation_ledger.json` — the anti-double-allocation record for pool bytes
  (never hand out placement space without going through it).

## patches/

* `code_patches.json` — 36 entries `{file_offset, old_hex, new_hex, what, why}`:
  render-path detours + caves, decoder hooks, one-byte render fixes, and the seven
  free-battle gameplay threshold windows. The builder asserts `old_hex` before writing.
* `raw_regions.json` — annotated residual regions not covered by any semantic table.
  **Currently empty; keep it that way** — a nonempty file means un-understood bytes.

## zh/files/ (→ `utils/data_files.py`)

`data/zh/files/README.md` documents each of the 28 files; eight layouts:

| layout | used by | model |
|---|---|---|
| `edits` | bark banks `0/1/1dd/1de/c4f`, `1db`, `1df`, `1e0`, `31e`, `b6f`, `1da` | in-place runs: re-encode `zh` at `offset`, 0x00-pad to `size`; optional `append` block (grown `1da`) |
| `cutin_groups` | `1dc` | whole-file rebuild: per record `header` + encoded `zh` + terminator `00 03 00 01` + 4-byte alignment padding; the arm9 offset table is derived from this file at build time |
| `table` | `b6e` | fixed-total-size name table rebuilt from entries at explicit offsets; `name_offset_words` patches the mirroring arm9 table |
| `bio_bank` | `324`, `c4b` | fixed-total-size encyclopedia banks rebuilt from encoded biographies at explicit record offsets |
| `graphics` | `42d`, `388`, `478`, `48a`, `c31` | raw-tile repaints `{offset, jp_hex, zh_hex}` with original-byte asserts (tiles, not text) |
| `atlas_graphics` | `3d3`–`3d7` | static BG labels rebuilt from committed 12x12 atlas cells; clear boxes and clean donor rows are explicit, and shared-tile resources are copy-on-write repacked/deduplicated within their original capacity |
| `settings_graphics` | `3e3`, `3e4` | paired settings canvases rebuilt from semantic descriptions and focused/unfocused button styles, with fixed-capacity copy-on-write repacking |
| `save_load_graphics` | `c34` | custom-LZSS save/load tile set plus layouts 2–21, rebuilt atomically so shared header/slot tiles cannot cross-contaminate |

## Cross-component couplings (regenerate together)

| if you change | also regenerate |
|---|---|
| `zh/files/battle/cutin_quotes.json` layout | nothing manual — the arm9 offset table + size word are build-derived |
| `zh/files/battle/ability_cards.json` append | `zh/ui.json resource_offsets` (`1da` entry) |
| `zh/files/hangar/part_names.json` layout | its own `name_offset_words` section |
| any placement string layout | every `ptr` that targets it (`zh/units.json`, `zh/characters.json`, `zh/ui.json`) |
| `font/atlas12.bin` size | nothing manual — autoload list + heap floor are computed |
| `utils/extract/` behavior | `data/jp/` (rerun the dump CLI; `extraction_fresh` enforces) |
